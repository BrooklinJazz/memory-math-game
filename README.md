The following is a summary of concepts in the book and the associated practice files.

# Instant Multiplication
- to multiply any two digit number by 11 simply add the two numbers together and put the result between them.
i.e. 23 * 11: 2 + 3 = 5. so 23 * 11 = 253
for results above 10 you have to move the 1 over.

i.e 85 * 11 = 8(13)5 = 935
